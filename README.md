# FriendsApp
Friends app that allows you to manage a group of friends.  A friend is defined as having a first name, last name, and an email address.  The friends are stored in 
a database and can be added, deleted, or updated.  The first screen provides a search engine where the user can enter an email and see if that friend is in the 
database.  If that friend exists in the database it will provide the corresponding first and last name of the friend.  If the email does not exist in the database 
it will provide a toast message saying so.  There is also a show friends button which will list friends as buttons in a grid layout.  Each button will have the 
friend's first name, last name, and email on it.  Buttons can be clicked and a toast message will appear.
